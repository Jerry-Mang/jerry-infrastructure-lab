## Objectives

Deploy a multi-node wireless mesh network using Ruijie EW1200R routers and manage the deployment remotely through Ruijie Cloud.

The project was designed to simulate a small branch office wireless deployment where a root router provides network services and additional wireless repeaters extend Wi-Fi coverage to remote areas without Ethernet cabling.

### Physical Topology

---

### Configuration

---

### Wireless Mesh

Both additional EW1200R units were powered on and automatically joined the root router as repeaters.

Cloud status:

Synced
Online

No manual WDS configuration was required.

---

### Client Testing

Successfully connected:

```text
EZVIZ Wireless Camera
```

Assigned IP:

```text
172.16.21.70
```

Verified:

- Wireless association
- DHCP assignment
- Internet access
- Mesh backhaul operation

### Findings

Automatic LAN Conflict Detection

Attempted LAN configuration:

```text
172.16.20.180
```

System automatically changed to:

```text
172.16.21.180
```

Reason:

The WAN interface was already operating on:

```text
172.16.20.0/24
```

Using the same subnet on both WAN and LAN would create routing conflicts.

ReyeeOS therefore automatically created:

```text
LAN = 172.16.21.0/24
```

to maintain proper NAT functionality.

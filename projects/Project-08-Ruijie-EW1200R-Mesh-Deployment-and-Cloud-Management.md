## Overview

This project documents the deployment and testing of a Ruijie EW1200R wireless mesh network environment.

The objective was to simulate a small branch office or remote site deployment where a root router provides Internet connectivity and additional wireless repeaters extend network coverage without requiring Ethernet cabling.

The deployment was fully managed through Ruijie Cloud and included remote device management, mesh synchronization, NAT services, DHCP services, client onboarding and wireless camera connectivity testing.

### Deployment Procedure

#### Step 1 - Root Router Deployment

The first EW1200R was deployed as the root router and connected to the existing CCTV network through VLAN 20.

Connection:

RG-ES226GC-P VLAN 20

↓

EW1200R Root Router WAN Port

WAN Address:

172.16.20.80

The device operated in Router Mode and provided DHCP and NAT services for the wireless mesh network.

---

#### Step 2 - Mesh Pairing

Two additional EW1200R units were powered on and joined the mesh network.

The pairing process was completed using the physical Mesh/Sync button on both devices.

No manual wireless bridge or WDS configuration was required.

After synchronization, both repeaters automatically appeared within Ruijie Cloud under the Root Router.

Cloud Status:

Synced

#### Step 3 - Wireless Backhaul Validation

The repeaters established wireless backhaul links to the Root Router.

#### Step 4 - Client Connectivitu Testing

An EZVIZ wireless camera was connected to the mesh network.

Assigned Address:

172.16.21.70

Validated:

Validated:

- Wireless client association
- DHCP address assignment
- Mesh backhaul communication
- Cloud management visibility
- Internet connectivity

#### Step 5 - Web Tunnel Remote Management

Ruijie Cloud successfully provided remote management access to all EW1200R devices.

Verified:

Device monitoring
Configuration management
Status monitoring
Web Tunnel remote access

No port forwarding was required.

### Findings

#### Automatic LAN Conflict Detection

An attempt was made to configure the LAN address as:

172.16.20.180

The system automatically changed the LAN address to:

172.16.21.180

Reason:

The WAN interface was already operating on:

172.16.20.0/24

Using the same subnet on both WAN and LAN interfaces would create a routing conflict.

ReyeeOS automatically generated:

172.16.21.0/24

to maintain proper NAT and routing functionality.

This demonstrated built-in Layer 3 conflict detection and automatic network correction features.

Figure 6 – Automatic subnet conflict detection. ReyeeOS changed the LAN subnet from 172.16.20.0/24 to 172.16.21.0/24 to avoid a WAN/LAN addressing conflict.

### Lessons Learned

This project provided practical experience with enterprise-style wireless mesh deployments and demonstrated how Ruijie Cloud can simplfy remote network management.

The deployment also highlighted the importantce of Layer 3 design considerations, particularly WAN and LAN subnet separation when NAT services are enabled.

The automatic subnet conflict detection feature within ReyeeOS provided additional insight into how modern networking platforma protect administrators from common configuration mistakes.

This project also demonstrated how modern wireless mesh solutions can be rapidly deployed and remotely managed through cloud-based platforms without requiring advanced wireless controller infrastructure.

# Microsoft Intune & Cloud Endpoint Management Lab

## Overview

This project focused on learning Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Entra ID, and modern cloud-based endpoint management technologies.

The objective was to understand how organisations centrally manage users, devices, compliance policies, configuration profiles, and application deployment through Microsoft cloud services.

The lab environment was integrated with an existing on-premises Active Directory infrastructure and VMware ESXi environment, providing practical experience with both traditional and cloud-based management approaches.

### Task 4 – Compliance Policies

Created and assigned a Windows 10/11 compliance policy in Microsoft Intune.

Configured policy requirements including:

- Password complexity controls
- Minimum password length
- Device security validation settings

Assigned policy to:

- All Users

Validated:

- Policy creation
- Policy assignment
- Compliance policy deployment workflow
- Compliance monitoring configuration

* Device synchronisation
* Policy verification

### Task 6 – Win32 Application Packaging

Packaged a Win32 application (7-Zip) using Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool.

Activities included:

* Application packaging
* IntuneWin creation
* Application upload
* Detection rule configuration
* Application assignment

### Task 7 – Deployment Troubleshooting

Investigated application deployment issues and performed troubleshooting.

Activities included:

* Device status verification
* Intune synchronisation
* Deployment status analysis
* Intune Management Extension verification
* Device registration analysis using dsregcmd

## Lessons Learned

### Traditional AD vs Cloud Management

Learned the differences between:

* Active Directory Domain Join
* Workplace Join
* Microsoft Entra Join

### Device Management

Gained practical experience with:

* Microsoft Intune administration
* Compliance policies
* Configuration profiles
* Device enrolment workflows

### Application Deployment

Learned the complete Win32 application deployment process:

* Packaging applications
* Uploading applications
* Assigning deployments
* Creating detection rules
* Monitoring deployment status

### Troubleshooting Skills

Identified an important deployment limitation during testing.

The Windows 10 lab device was:

* Domain Joined
* Workplace Joined

but not:

* Microsoft Entra Joined

This resulted in Microsoft Intune Management Extension not being available, preventing successful Win32 application deployment.

This provided valuable experience in endpoint troubleshooting and root cause analysis.

Objectives:

* Microsoft Entra Join
* Microsoft Intune enrolment
* Cloud-native device management

### Application Deployment Validation

Deploy and validate:

* Google Chrome
* 7-Zip
* Notepad++

using a fully supported Entra Joined device.

### Security Enhancements

Future learning areas:

* BitLocker Management
* Conditional Access
* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
* Microsoft Defender Integration

### Hybrid Identity

Future project:

* Microsoft Entra Connect
* Hybrid Identity
* Hybrid Device Join

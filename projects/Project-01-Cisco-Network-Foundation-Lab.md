## Cisco DHCP Configuration

Multiple DHCP pools were configured for segmented VLAN networks.

## Technologies Explored

- VLAN segmentation
- Router-on-a-stick
- NAT/PAT
- SSH management
- VMware ESXi networking
- Windows Active Directory concepts

---

## Router-on-a-Stick Configuration

The Cisco 1941 router was configured using subinterfaces for inter-VLAN routing.

## NAT Overload Configuration

NAT overload (PAT) was configured to provide internet access for internal VLAN networks.

## Troubleshooting and Lessons Learned

The project involved several networking and infrastructure troubleshooting scenarios which helped develop practical enterprise troubleshooting experience.

### ESXi Management Connectivity Loss

At one stage, incorrect VLAN tagging caused the ESXi management interface to become unreachable.

### Troubleshooting Process

The issue was investigated by checking switchport VLAN configuration and ESXi management network settings.

The problem was resolved by configuring the switch port correctly as an access port for VLAN 10.

---

### Native VLAN Mismatch

A native VLAN mismatch warning was encountered between switches during trunk configuration.

This issue improved understanding of trunking behaviour and VLAN consistency across interconnected switches.

---

### Router-on-a-Stick Configuration

Initial inter-VLAN routing configuration required troubleshooting of subinterface encapsulation and VLAN trunk behaviour.

This helped improve understanding of Layer 2 and Layer 3 integration within enterprise-style networks.
